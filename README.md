# Restaurant-Sales-Forecast
This project uses Time Series Analysis to forecast sales.

I collected data from my dad's newly opened Restaurant which covers approximately 4 months record of the total sales each day.  Analysis was made and some insights discovered, the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used.
